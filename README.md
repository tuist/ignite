# Ignite

Ignite is an executable that provides an alternative LLM-based coding experience to build apps. It can be used in multiple ways:

- **Locally with Tuist CLI**: Run `tuist ignite` to access the LLM-powered coding experience directly from your terminal
- **Remotely via Tuist Platform**: Access Ignite through the Tuist platform or app, where we provide the coding environment so you can code on the go or from non-macOS environments

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
